While practices are situationally specific, principles are deep, fundamental truths that have universal application. They apply to individuals, to marriages, to families, to private and public organizations of every kind. When these truths are internalized into habits, they empower people to create a wide variety of practices to deal with different situations."

Two statements may be said concerning this individual. One is that he suffers from defects of spontaneity and individuality which may seem to be incurable.

Both are fully attentive to the procedure, but the older nurse occasionally strokes your son’s head, as though trying to comfort him. The younger nurse is all business. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that there was conclusive proof that patients under deep anesthetic don’t hear or feel anything. If that were the case, then what should be your reaction to the two nurses? If you are a utilitarian, you should have no preference. The older nurse’s actions did nothing to reduce suffering or improve the surgical outcome. If you are a Kantian, you’d also give the older nurse no extra credit. She seems to have acted absentmindedly, or (even worse, for Kant) she acted on her feelings. She did not act out of commitment to a universalizable principle. But if you are a Humean, then it is perfectly proper for you to like and praise the older nurse. She has so fully acquired the virtue of caring that she does it automatically and effortlessly, even when it has no effect. She is a virtuoso of caring, which is a fine and beautiful thing in a nurse."

But of all pleasures sex is the one which the civilized man pursues with the greatest anxiey. That the craving is brainy rather than bodily is shown by the common impotence of the male when he comes to the act, his brain pursuing what his genes do not at the moment desire. This confuses him hopelessly, because he simply cannot understand not wanting the great delicacy of sex when it is available. He has been hankering after it for hours and days on end, but when the reality appears his body will not co-operate."

What we have to discover is that there is no safety, that seeking it is painful, and that when we imagine that we have found it, we don’t like it. In other words, if we can really understand what we are looking for—that safety is isolation, and what we do to ourselves when we look for it—we shall see that we do not want it at all.

    "Content": "There is no uniform and universal relationship between a stressor and the stress response. Each stress event is singular and is experienced in the present, but it also has its resonance from the past. The intensity of the stress experience and its long-term consequences depend on many factors unique to each individual. What defines stress for each of us is a matter of personal disposition and, even more, of personal history."

What we want and demand from the world needs to conform to our present needs, not to unconscious, unsatisfied needs from childhood. If distinctions between past and present blur, we will perceive loss or the threat of loss where none exists; and the awareness of those genuine needs that do require satisfaction, rather than their repression for the sake of gaining the acceptance or approval of others."

The repression of anger is not an abstract emotional trait that mysteriously leads to disease. It is a major risk factor because it increases physiological stress on the organism."

The sense of hopelessness follows from the chronic inability to be true to oneself on the deepest level. And hopelessness leads to helplessness, since nothing one can do is perceived as making any difference."

    "Content": "Whatever their social complexion, all European states had to come to terms with the emergence of a new kind of cultural space–the public sphere. Situated between the private world of the family and the official world of the state, the public sphere was a forum in which previously isolated individuals could come together to exchange information, ideas and criticism. Whether communicating with each other at long range by subscribing to the same periodicals, or meeting face to face in a coffee-house or in one of the new voluntary associations, such as a reading club or Masonic lodge, the public acquired a collective weight far greater than the sum of its individual members. It was from the public sphere that a new source of authority emerged to challenge the opinion-makers of the old regime: public opinion."

Hisz a plongeurénál aligha van egyszerűbb élet! Napjai a munka és az alvás monoton ritmusában telnek anélkül, hogy bármi ideje jutna gondolkodni; a külvilág szinte meg sem érinti, Párizs csupán a szállodára, a metróra, néhány bisztróra és az ágyára zsugorodik. Ha kimozdul is, legfeljebb néhány utcányira flörtölni egy felszolgálólánnyal, aki ölébe ülve nyeli az osztrigát és a sört. Szabadnapján délig az ágyban hever, tiszta inget vesz fel, italban kockázik, és ebéd után ismét ledől. Semmi sem egészen valóságos számára, csupán a boulot, az ital, no meg az alvás – amely mind közül a legfontosabb."

Kisszerű, nyomorult irigység élt benne mindenki iránt, akinek kicsit is jobb sors jutott – nem a gazdagokat irigyelte, hisz ezek messze kívül estek az ő szociális látóterén, csupán azokat, akiknek volt munkájuk. Úgy sóvárgott a munka után, ahogy egy művész eped a hírnév után. Ha dolgozni látott egy öregembert, fanyarul megjegyezte: „Némmá azt a vén f...t, az ilyenek miatt nem jut munkához a magam fajtája!” Ha viszont az illető netán fiatal fiú volt, Paddy így dohogott: „Ezek miatt a taknyosok miatt nem jut minekünk kenyér!” Minden külföldiben csak „rohadék digót” látott, szentül hitte ugyanis, hogy a munkanélküliségről egyedül a bevándorlók tehetnek."

    "Content": "Given this stunning lack of progress earned at such horrific cost, it might seem reasonable to imagine that the thoughts of the various warring nations would now turn toward peace, to trying to find some way out of the mess. Instead, precisely the opposite was happening. It’s a question that has faced peoples and nations at war since the beginning of time, and usually produced a terrible answer: in contemplating all the lives already lost, the treasure squandered, how to ever admit it was for nothing? Since such an admission is unthinkable, and the status quo untenable, the only option left is to escalate. Thus among the warring states in Europe at the end of 1915 it was no longer a matter of satisfying what had brought them into the conflict in the first place—and in many cases, those reasons had been shockingly trivial—but to expand beyond them, the acceptable terms for peace not lowered, but raised. This conflict was no longer about playing for small advantage against one’s imperial rivals, but about hobbling them forever, ensuring that they might never again have the capability to wage such a devastating and pointless war. But defeating one’s enemies is only half the game; for a war to be truly justifiable one has to materially gain. In modern European custom, that need had been sated by the payment of war reparations into the victor’s coffers, the grabbing of a disputed province here or there, but that seemed rather picayune in view of this conflict’s cost. Instead, all the slaughter was to be justified by a new golden age of empire, the victors far richer, far grander than before. Naturally, this simply propelled the cycle to its logical, murderous conclusion. When contemplating all to be conferred upon the eventual winners, and all to be taken from the losers, how to possibly quit now? No, what was required was greater commitment—more soldiers, more money, more loss—to be redeemed when victory finally came with more territory, more wealth, more power."
